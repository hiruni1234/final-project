                 <h1>WHY CHOOSE THIS COURSE</h1>
            <p>Exploring the interior spaces of our buildings today is more fascinating than ever. New technology is allowing us to create animations and virtual environments that bring ideas to life. If you love architecture and want to optimise the interior spaces where we live, work and play, this degree has been designed for you.

During the course you will conceptualise and develop your designs through expertise in spatial thinking and detailed resolution, using models, full-scale material constructs and digital animations.</p>
